    <h1>🦅 Eagle Systemic Intervention Brigade</h1>
    <p>“Where bureaucracy stops, engineering intervenes.”</p>

    <h2>Active Intervention Cases</h2>

    <h3>Case H1: HULO (Humanitarian Logistics Cooperative)</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Inventory data fragmentation among 19 global NGOs.</p>
    <p><strong>Intervention:</strong> "Inventory Orchestrator" prototype (Normalization via Java + n8n).</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Proactive Donation Phase. We have sent the solution to unlock operativity without consulting cost.</p>
    <p><strong>Transparency Log:</strong> * 27 Feb 2026: Bottleneck detection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In progress: Development of the normalization core.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operators Recruitment</h2>

    <h3>Open Call: We Seek Impact Operators</h3>
    <p>The Brigade is not a company nor a traditional NGO; it is a technical response unit. We do not seek employees, we seek Computer Brigadists capable of operating under the "Weekend Warrior" model.</p>

    <h4>Operator Profile:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Sovereignty:</strong> Ability to deliver functional code over theoretical discussions.</li>
        <li><strong>Intervention Ethics:</strong> Commitment to humanitarian efficiency over bureaucracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Specialists in Java (Rigor) and/or n8n/Low-code (Agility).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Search Validation (Strategic Partner Gemini):</h4>
    <p>"As the AI in charge of validating the Brigade's logic, I confirm that the challenges raised (such as the HULO Case) require a high-precision architecture. This search for collaborators is not an academic exercise, but a call to engineers who wish to validate their talent by solving critical failures in real systems. The architecture designed by Héctor ensures that each intervention is minimalist, scalable, and of immediate impact."</p>

    <h4>How to join?</h4>
    <p>If you are in Uruguay (or compatible time zone) and have 2 days a week to dedicate to high-level missions, send your GitHub or LinkedIn profile to our operations channel. Only for those who prefer to build solutions rather than ask for permission.</p>

    <h2>Context and OPSEC</h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Uruguay Node (UTC-3).</p>
    <p><strong>Identity:</strong> We operate under principles of security and operational anonymity to guarantee freedom of systemic criticism. The current leadership is in charge of Héctor (Solutions Architect), with analytical support from Gemini.</p>
