# 🦅 Brigada del Águila (Eagle Brigade)

**Restoring Systemic Coherence through AI-Assisted Interventions.**

This project is the landing hub and documentation center for the **Brigada del Águila**, a technical unit dedicated to solving high-impact systemic bottlenecks in humanitarian and organizational infrastructures.

## 🚀 Mission & Philosophy

The Brigade operates on the principle of **Technical Sovereignty**:
- **Logic over Code**: We don't build software for vanity; we design logical interventions to solve real-world problems.
- **Minimalist Intervention**: Our goal is sustainability. A successful intervention leaves a system functioning autonomously.
- **AI-Amplified Cogntion**: We use AI not as a replacement for developers, but as a cognitive amplifier for logical rigor and rapid orchestration.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Responsive landing page built with **HTML5** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Backend/Logic Engine**: **Java 21** for robust, high-performance data processing.
- **Orchestration**: **n8n** for agile workflow automation.
- **Localization**: Full support for English (root) and Spanish (`/es/`).
